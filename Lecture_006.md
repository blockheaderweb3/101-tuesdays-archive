# Lecture 006

GM @everyone

Welcome to today's edition of 101-tuesdays.
Trust we had a wonderful day.

So let's get started.
Apologies guys for starting later than the scheduled time.
@David_  is pretty busy as such I'd be taking today's session.
We will be talking about 

### POAPs 

What it is, how it can be used and of course how to claim the POAP for the recently concluded meetup that held on Saturday.
I'm sure many of us are well familiar with this concept but again we are using this platform to further explain this buzzword.

So let's go.

Just before I start, I hope we've all received the email containing the link to claim our last meetup's POAP.
If you haven't, please feel free to DM me.

What is POAP?

It simply means **_Proof of Attendance Protocol_**.

It is: 
- **A Non-Fungible Token** (NFT - meaning it is unique - each token is uniquely distinguishable on the blockchain) running on Gnosis Chain.
- **ERC-721 compliant** (it strictly follows specified implementation of standard API for NFTs within Ethereum smart contracts).
- **A digital collectible** that can be used to represents life events/remarkable moments e.t.c.


Just to clarify that there's:

1. POAP protocol 
2. POAP instance/NFT

These 2 two although spelt the same have different meaning depending on the context of use. 

The **POAP Protocol** simply refers to the core smart contract that enables the minting and recombination of memories
by POAP issuers (individual/entity who issue POAP) and collectors (individuals who collect POAP NFT as proof of participation in an event).

**POAP NFT** refers to the digital record that is generated by utilizing the POAP protocol.

So in our case, BlockHeader Web3, is the issuing entity for POAP #32487 
whose metadata (collection data - details about this given POAP) can be accessed and analyzed on  https://poap.gallery/event/32487.
This number **#32487** is the unique ID for our event in the POAP ecosystem.

So let's dive into how to claim our POAP

Remember this POAP can be used as digital badge to represent cryptographically provable participation in our meetup.
To claim our POAP, you need a non-custodial wallet.
For details, please refer to this [message](https://discord.com/channels/917010077154680902/940547005535625216/940660548557746196)

Just to clarify, crypto exchange wallets (Binance, Coinbase, Huobi, Kucoin etc) are also referred to as custodial wallets 
because you do not control the mnemonic phrase/private key of such wallets, as such you should not attempt to use such wallet address to claim your POAP NFT.
After successful installation of a non-custodial wallet, copy and paste the POAP claim link on your browser.

In my case, I'm using my desktop browser where I have MetaMask installed.

You should have the following screen if you paste the POAP claim link on your browser.
As clearly shown in the input field, you're requested to paste your Ethereum wallet address (again please double-check your wallet address entry). 
I will show some shortcut while copying and pasting a given wallet address.

We must agree that Ethereum wallet address (42 hexadecimal characters) is pretty hard to read. You could mistakenly omit/prepend/append some characters  while entering it and this can nullify your entry. 
So I usually double check the first-5 characters and the last-5 characters of the wallet address I paste to make sure it correctly matches the wallet address I copied.
So make sure you do check the first-5 & the last-5 characters of the wallet address you intend to copy in the input field provided.

For instance, using  my test wallet address `0x5ec9C6...9CD17943C`, I'd refer to:

`0x5ec`: first-5 characters

`7943C`: last-5 characters 

When you click *Mint POAP token*, you should have the below loading screen.

Then this screen shows you've successfully claimed the POAP.

You can select Browse Collection to view your gallery of POAPs.

By clicking browse collection, I'm redirected [here](https://app.poap.xyz/scan/0x5ec9C6F1CF9F3c5D10bE3Ae4507e7099CD17943C) where I can view all my POAP collections.

So POAPs are pretty helpful.
We can persist records of our participation in real-life events on the blockchain.

With this, we've come to the end of this session.


# QnA

### Q: 
I saw something like minting when claiming , I would need clarification on that.

### A: 
Good question 
Minting refers to the process of generating a new POAP on the blockchain. 
By minting, you are bringing an instance of our unique token (POAP) into existence on the blockchain
