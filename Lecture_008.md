Hello everyone

Welcome to 101 Tuesday

We'll be talking about 

**The Importance of design in web3**

Design plays an incredibly important role in the adoption of web3. As most users will be onboarded into the world of blockchain through dApps, 
how they journey through this technical space can be heavily hindered or supported by design.

Similar to normal web 2.0 apps, design considerations will change slightly depending on the dApp type (e.g. finance vs gaming vs arts and collectibles). 
However, due to the nature and current stage of blockchain adoption, there’s a few generalised design principles to consider: 

- Enable blockchain literacy.

One thing that’s glaringly obvious about the state of web 3 is that it’ll require new mental models and ways of thinking that people don’t generally have (yet). 

As designers, helping educate can be done by:

1. Connecting users back to what they do know to help them bridge the knowledge gap. 

2. Reducing the amount of technical jargon.

3. Showing enough without overwhelming.

4. Communicate using value, not technical how-to.

5. Presenting actionable routes/next steps.
