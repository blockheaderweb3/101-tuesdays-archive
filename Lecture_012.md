# Lecture 012

Good evening everyone.

My name is Umar, A Product Designer.

Today, I'll be talking about  **_Crafting better User Experiences in blockchain_**

If you have any questions at the end of it, feel free to ask.

So let's get started.

## Crafting a Better User Experience for Blockchain

Decentralized, distributed and televised networks are now top of mind for nearly every business or startup. As more decentralized apps are entering the market, 
it's important we take out time to see what it takes to create a UX design for blockchain.

To start with, User Experience for Blockchain is still User Experience. At its core, the principles that applies for UX in the web2 space still applies for web3, 
just with an extra bit of attention to certain key features. These features are what makes blockchain what it is today.

The basic principles of UX design for blockchain focus on the concept of "**DESIGNING FOR TRUST**". As the technology is still new to many industries, 
trust plays an important role. To make the most out of decentralization, design should focus on the spheres where this technology can create the biggest values, 
such as facilitating purchasing flow or improving transparency and security of legal contracts.

Some key features of blockchain include:

- Security
- Speed
- Hashes
- Personal Keys


**Security**:

From the first interaction with a blockchain product, users need to be assured that their data is safe and protected. Since more often, users provide sensitive
data such as legal documents and personal information, it is important that they feel a sense of security while providing this. 
Using tooltip and popup messages that ensures this during important steps will work wonders.

**Speed**:

It is important to note that speed of transaction in the blockchain is relatively slower than it is in regular web2 transactions. 
A 5 seconds transaction in centralized platforms can become a one minute transaction in the blockchain. As users wont be used to this, 
best practice will be to keep them in the loop at each step while showing them transaction process. Providing constant feedback is key.

**Hashes**:

Personal blockchain keys or hashes are very long and sometimes its needed to be shorten, although users tend to apply the hashes as it is. 
Providing a way to copy and paste these long hashes is the easiest way to improve on their user experience.

**Personal Keys**:

This is the biggest mental model block in web3, the inability of users to reset their passwords when lost or forgotten. 
Blockchain disrupts this pattern completely and it is vital that as a designer you ensure the user is aware if this information from the onboarding process. 
They need to know that loosing their personal keys can lead to loosing their account completely.

# UX Best Practices for Blockchain

Here are some of the best UX practices for blockchain.

* **Ensure consistency**

While designing a new experience, we need to ensure consistency accross screens. This makes the user more comfortable while interacting with the product.

* **Mind the irreversibility**

Transactions cant be reverted or canceled while using blockchain. It is essential to make sure users are aware of this. 
Providing an info tip before a transaction to make users aware of this helps.

* **Guide your users**

There is a thin line between making your users feel stupid and guiding them. 
Gentle guidance helps users reach their goals from the onset and prevents them from making mistakes along the lines. UX writing plays an important role here

* **Encourage feedback**

When you offer a new experience, 
there is most likely a lack of approved patterns of users behaviours hence you will need to create an avenue for users to provide feedback; propositions or complaints.

# Conclusion
To sum this up, decentralisation introduces many opportunities, but also increases a userâ€™s responsibility, especially in terms of irreversibility or losing a 
personal key. Having said that, we expect users to get to grips with the advantages and security of blockchain in the long-term. 
As designers we play an important role in seeing the mass adoption of blockchain through providing the right user experience.

This will be all for todays session. Kindly ask questions if you have any.
