# Lecture 013
Hello everyone! 

Tobi here again ðŸ˜Ž

Welcome to another 101 Tuesday session. I'll be heading it today.
I'm a product designer (freelance).

Today, we will be talking about **_Wireframing in Design_**

### What is a wireframe?

The  goal of a wireframe is to describe the structure and functionality of a userâ€™s flow â€“ functionality being anything that the user interacts with, 
such as buttons, menus, and dropdowns. This is achieved by creating a visual representation that communicates the productâ€™s structure, information hierarchy, 
behavior, navigation and placement of content. Without touching on the visual details or the UI design, a wireframe demonstrates the productâ€™s general layout
and states which elements need to be included on each page. There are many available wireframe tools for UX designers to choose from.

### What types of wireframes are there?

- **Low fidelity wireframes**
   
   You should always start the process with rough hand drawn sketches. 
   Only then move on to low fidelity wireframes. Some programs that can assist you for this are Axure and Balsamiq. 
   Low fidelity wireframes enable you to create relatively quick sketches that present the productâ€™s main screens and clarify which screen leads to which. 
   This will give you a better feel for the product.
   
- **High fidelity wireframes** 
   
   At this point, your wireframe should show the full lifecycle of the flow, covering the complete range of cases a user can 
   find themselves in â€“ from errors, to empty states, first time users and returning users.
   
   Shortly, we will explore a few steps in creating great wireframes.
   
### Steps in Creating Wireframes
   
1. Articulate - Firstly, it is important to understand who youâ€™re designing for and exactly what the problem youâ€™re trying to solve is.

2. Generate - This part to most people is the fun part. You get to explore the ideas in your head on paper or using any wireframing tools
   like Balsamiq, sketch etc.To make great ideas a reality, we must act, experiment, fail, adapt. In doing so we get to express ourselves and
   see every angle. This tools(sketch or Balsamiq) gives you freedom to design just as you imagine. There are no bad ideas, exploring all the 
   options available to you is always an advantage so it is a lot better to finish up any design. And if youâ€™re not comfortable it is easy to
   scrap it and start again. Speed and quality is essential in this step. Design as much as you like in this stage. Let the ideas flow.

3. Iterate - Now you should start seeing some solid user interface concepts come to live that you feel excited about. 
   This is because you explored every options that came to mind and thatâ€™s the goal in this step is to piece together 
   the best parts of the idea you visualized in the previous step. You need to collect and combine the best concepts that 
   solves the users needs in a very refined way. It is also good to leave out the finer details like fonts, colors, and interaction 
   details that will seem distracting for the next step.

4. Communicate - More often some people make the mistake of thinking that because theyâ€™ve arrived at a solution or a good design then theyâ€™re done, 
   but thereâ€™s more to it. Itâ€™s like having talking and but no one understands you. Those great designs are just half the job, communicating those ideas and designs
   effectively can take as much effort.

5. Validate - Lastly, and this is a very important step. There needs to be an opportunity to gather feedback on the designs after communicating it. 
   Now your deisgns makes sense to everyone, itâ€™s time to know if it works as well as youâ€™ve imagined. Get people with the best idea of the product 
   and ask them how the proposed design solves their problems and make changes accordingly.
   
Finally,

People often feel surprised to know how broad wireframing is, or take any formal process in making it but hopefully this article has shown much value in taking time 
to craft a great wireframe and doing it the right way.
